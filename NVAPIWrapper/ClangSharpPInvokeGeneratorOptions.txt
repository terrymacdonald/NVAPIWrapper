  # Codegen Options
  compatible-codegen                      Bindings should be generated with .NET Standard 2.0 compatibility. Setting this disables preview code generation.
  default-codegen                         Bindings should be generated for the current LTS version of .NET/C#. This is currently .NET 8/C# 12.
  latest-codegen                          Bindings should be generated for the current STS version of .NET/C#. This is currently .NET 10/C# 14.
  preview-codegen                         Bindings should be generated for the preview version of .NET/C#. This is currently .NET 10/C# 14.
  # File Options
  single-file                             Bindings should be generated to a single output file. This is the default.
  multi-file                              Bindings should be generated so there is approximately one type per file.
  # Type Options
  unix-types                              Bindings should be generated assuming Unix defaults. This is the default on Unix platforms.
  windows-types                           Bindings should be generated assuming Windows defaults. This is the default on Windows platforms.
  # Exclusion Options
  exclude-anonymous-field-helpers         The helper ref properties generated for fields in nested anonymous structs and unions should not be generated.
  exclude-com-proxies                     Types recognized as COM proxies should not have bindings generated. These are currently function declarations ending with _UserFree, _UserMarshal, _UserSize, _UserUnmarshal, _Proxy, or _Stub.
  exclude-default-remappings              Default remappings for well known types should not be added. This currently includes intptr_t, ptrdiff_t, size_t, and uintptr_t
  exclude-empty-records                   Bindings for records that contain no members should not be generated. These are commonly encountered for opaque handle like types such as HWND.
  exclude-enum-operators                  Bindings for operators over enum types should not be generated. These are largely unnecessary in C# as the operators are available by default.
  exclude-fnptr-codegen                   Generated bindings for latest or preview codegen should not use function pointers.
  exclude-funcs-with-body                 Bindings for functions with bodies should not be generated.
  exclude-using-statics-for-enums         Enum usages should be fully qualified and should not include a corresponding 'using static EnumName;'
  # Vtbl Options
  explicit-vtbls                          VTBLs should have an explicit type generated with named fields per entry.
  implicit-vtbls                          VTBLs should be implicit to reduce metadata bloat. This is the current default
  trimmable-vtbls                         VTBLs should be defined but not used in helper methods to reduce metadata bloat when trimming.
  # Test Options
  generate-tests-nunit                    Basic tests validating size, blittability, and associated metadata should be generated for NUnit.
  generate-tests-xunit                    Basic tests validating size, blittability, and associated metadata should be generated for XUnit.
  # Generation Options
  generate-aggressive-inlining            [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining)] should be added to generated helper functions.
  generate-callconv-member-function       Instance function pointers should use [CallConvMemberFunction] where applicable.
  generate-cpp-attributes                 [CppAttributeList("")] should be generated to document the encountered C++ attributes.
  generate-disable-runtime-marshalling    [assembly: DisableRuntimeMarshalling] should be generated.
  generate-doc-includes                   <include> xml documentation tags should be generated for declarations.
  generate-file-scoped-namespaces         Namespaces should be scoped to the file to reduce nesting.
  generate-guid-member                    Types with an associated GUID should have a corresponding member generated.
  generate-helper-types                   Code files should be generated for various helper attributes and declared transparent structs.
  generate-macro-bindings                 Bindings for macro-definitions should be generated. This currently only works with value like macros and not function-like ones.
  generate-marker-interfaces              Bindings for marker interfaces representing native inheritance hierarchies should be generated.
  generate-native-bitfield-attribute      [NativeBitfield("", offset: #, length: #)] attribute should be generated to document the encountered bitfield layout.
  generate-native-inheritance-attribute   [NativeInheritance("")] attribute should be generated to document the encountered C++ base type.
  generate-generic-pointer-wrapper        Pointer<T> should be used for limited generic type support.
  generate-setslastsystemerror-attribute  [SetsLastSystemError] attribute should be generated rather than using SetLastError = true.
  generate-template-bindings              Bindings for template-definitions should be generated. This is currently experimental.
  generate-unmanaged-constants            Unmanaged constants should be generated using static ref readonly properties. This is currently experimental.
  generate-vtbl-index-attribute           [VtblIndex(#)] attribute should be generated to document the underlying VTBL index for a helper method.
  # Stripping Options
  strip-enum-member-type-name             Strips the enum type name from the beginning of its member names.
  # Logging Options
  log-exclusions                          A list of excluded declaration types should be generated. This will also log if the exclusion was due to an exact or partial match.
  log-potential-typedef-remappings        A list of potential typedef remappings should be generated. This can help identify missing remappings.
  log-visited-files                       A list of the visited files should be generated. This can help identify traversal issues.
