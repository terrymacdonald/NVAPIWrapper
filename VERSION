# IGCLWrapper Version Configuration
#
# This file defines the MAJOR and MINOR version components.
# The PATCH/build number is automatically calculated from git commit count.
#
# Semantic Versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
#   - MAJOR: Increment for incompatible API changes (manually set here)
#   - MINOR: Increment for new functionality in a backward-compatible manner (manually set here)
#   - PATCH: Auto-generated from git commit count since last version change (automatically calculated)
#
# Example: With MAJOR=1, MINOR=2, and 150 commits since last change of this file? Version 1.2.150
#
# To update the version:
#   1. Edit MAJOR or MINOR values below
#   2. Commit the change
#   3. Run build_adlx.ps1 (or build in Visual Studio) - it will automatically use the new version with current commit count
#

MAJOR=1
MINOR=0
